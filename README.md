Smugglr<br>
A fun app allowing the user to choose a destination country which generates a randomized list of three smugglers to choose from to hire.

Motivation<br>
School project utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.

API<br>
I used https://randomuser.me/<br>
Documentation: https://randomuser.me/documentation

Issues<br>
In the mobile view in the Console tab the responsiveness is correct. The profiles do not properly cycle through when the app is pulled up on an actual cell phone. I have not been able to resolve this issue.
